[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

## Overview

Chatbot is an application that uses conversational AI for language learning to help users gain fluency in their target language (work in progress).

Users can chat with a conversational AI, practice specific scenarios, and track their learning progress.

Features:

- A language learning website implemented Flask
- Chats with a conversational AI powered by GPT-3
- Grammar correction and other learning feaatures

## Usage

### Installation

The package uses `python3.9`.

First clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:franksh/chatbot.git
cd chatbot
```

It is recommended to also set up and activate a
virtual environment, for example using

```bash
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then, install the application and dependencies as a package in development mode using

```bash
make install
```

which is equivalent to running

```bash
pip install -e .
```

which installs the application as a package in developer (local edit) mode.

### Configuration

Create a file `.env` at the project root (if it doesn't exist yet)
and specify the following variables before running the application:

Several variables are stored in the `.env` file and should be configured
before running the application:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: The api key for OpenAi.
- `OPENAI_ENGINE`: Which GPT-3 engine to use. For testing, a simpler engine is used. Can be one of: ada (cheapest), babbage, curie, davinci (most expensive, most powerful)

### Running the application

Before running the application, initialize the user database

```bash
flask init-db
```

Start the application from the root project directory using

```bash
flask run
```

If the application is installed, you can also start
it from anywhere using

```bash
export FLASK_APP=chatbot
flask run
```

### Useful commands

- `flask run`: Run the application.
- `flask init-db`: Initialize the database.
- `flask shell`: Start an interactive Python shell in the application context, with an app instance imported

## Testing

### Running Unit Tests

You can run tests using

```bash
pytest
```

Add the `-v` flag to show the result for each test function.

To measure the code coverage of the tests, use the `coverage` command:

```bash
coverage run -m pytest
```

You can view the coverage report using

```bash
coverage report
# or
coverage html
```

### Testing in the Flask shell

The flask application can also be tested from the shell.

Start the shell with

```bash
flask shell
```

In the shell, you can test endpoints like so:

```python
>>> client = app.test_client()
>>> client.get('/')
<WrapperTestResponse streamed [200 OK]>
>>> client.post(
      '/auth/register',
      data={'username': username, 'password': password}
    )
```

### Load testing with locust

To test the application under user traffic, do

```bash
cd tests/
locust
```

which will open a dashboard at `http://0.0.0.0:8089/`. There you can simulate users retrieving different endpoints. More complex fuctionality can be added in `tests/locustfile.py`.

### Profiling with py-spy

To profile the app, first get the process id (`pid`) of the running flask app, for example using

```bash
ps | grep flask
```

Then you can record the app's activity using

```bash
py-spy record -o profile.svg --pid <pid>
```

You can interact with the app for a while (or run a `locust` load test), after a while stop the `py-spy` process, which will save a flame graph of the apps activity.

## Deployment

### Deploying on AWS EC2

This describes how to deploy the app using docker.

First clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:franksh/chatbot.git
cd chatbot
```

Then build the image using

```bash
docker build . --tag chatbot
```

To run the app (and keep running in background), start the container as

```bash
docker run -dp 80:80 chatbot:latest
```

### Manual deployment on AWS EC2

The following outlines some steps if not using `docker` as described above

#### Installing pytorch

We encountered a bug when installing `pytorch` on an AWS EC2 instance, where the installation with `pip` did not finish. To circumvent this, use

```bash
pip install --no-cache-dir torch
```

or, for all requirements,

```bash
pip install -e . --no-cache-dir
```

#### Serving the app

```bash
waitress-serve --call 'chatbot:create_app'
```

#### Ports on AWS EC2

waitress serves the app on port 8080. To redirect to port 80, use

```bash
sudo iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8080
```

#### Other

Install `git lfs`

```bash
sudo apt install git-lfs
```

### Docker

Docker image is specified in the docker file.

Build the image using

```bash
docker build . --tag chatbot
```

Start the container (and keep running in background)

```bash
docker run -dp 80:80 chatbot:latest
```

For testing, run the container and delete after user with

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 --rm chatbot:latest
```

(ports are not necessary on the server, but on mac you have to specify the ports `8080:80 ` because `80` is already in use).

or in interactive mode to inspect the contents:

```bash
docker run -it --rm chatbot:latest bash
```
